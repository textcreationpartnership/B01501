         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the many Mercies of GOD to theſe poor Nations, your
peaceable Reſtauration is not the leaſt: it is His work alone, and to Him
belongs the glory of it: and I eſteem it as a great effect of His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to me, that He was pleaſed to make me amongſt many worthier in your
ſervice, ſome way inſtrumental in it. I did nothing but my duty, and do
not deſerve to receive ſo great honour and reſpect as you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give me at this time and place; which I ſhall ever acknowledge as an high
mark of your favour to me. Sir, I ſhall not now trouble you with large
Narratives, only give me leave to acquaint you, that as I marcht from
<hi>Scotland</hi> hither, I obſerved <pb n="4" facs="tcp:174778:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>the People in
moſt Counties in great and earneſt Expectations of Settlement; and they
made ſeveral Applications to me, with numerous Subſcriptions: the
chiefeſt heads of their Deſires, were, <hi>For a Free and Full Parliament;
and, that you would determine your ſitting; A Goſpel-Miniſtry,
Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities; And for Admittance of the
Members ſecluded before</hi> 1648. <hi>without any previous Oath or
Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To which I commonly anſwered, That you are now in a Free
Parliament; and if there be any force remaining upon you, I would endeavour to
remove it; and that you had Voted to fill up your Houſe, and then you would
be a full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament alſo; and that you had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined your
ſitting: and for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, their Maintenance, the Lawes and
Univerſities, you had largely declared in your laſt Declaration; and I was
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <pb n="5" facs="tcp:174778:4"/>you would adhere to it: but as for thoſe
Gentlemen ſecluded in the year 1648 I told them you had given Judgment in it;
and all People ought to acquieſce in that Judgment: but to admit any Members
to ſit in Parliament, without a previous Oath or Engagement to Secure the
Government in being, it was never yet done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And, although
I ſaid it not to them, I muſt ſay with pardon to you, That the leſſe
Oaths and Engagements are impoſed, (with reſpect had to the Security of the
Common Cauſe) your Settlement will be the ſooner attained to. I am the more
particular in theſe matters, to let you ſee how gratefull your preſent
Conſultations about theſe things will be to the People. I know all the
ſober Gentry will heartily cloſe with you, if they may be tenderly and
gently uſed; and I am ſure, you will ſo uſe them, as knowing it to be
our Common <pb n="6" facs="tcp:174778:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Concern, to expatiate, and not narrow our
Intereſts; and to be carefull neither the Cavalier nor Phanatick Party have
yet a ſhare in your Civil or Military Power; of the laſt of whoſe
impatience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you have had ſo ſevere Experience.</p>
            <p>I ſhould ſay ſomething of <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<hi>Scotland:</hi> Indeed <hi>Ireland</hi> is in an ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made
worſe by your ſudden In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, which prevented the paſsing an Act
for the Settlement of the Eſtates of Adventurers and Souldiers there, which I
heard you intended to have done in a few dayes; and I preſume it will be
quickly done, being ſo neceſſary at this time, when the wants of the
Commonwealth call for ſupplies, and People will unwillingly pay Taxes for
thoſe Eſtates of which they have no Legal Aſſurance. I need not tell
you how much your Favour was abuſed in the Nomination of your Officers of
your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <pb n="7" facs="tcp:174778:5"/>there; their Malice hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
manifeſted: I dare affirm that thoſe now that have declared for you, will
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithfull, and thereby evince, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well there, as here, it is
the ſober Intereſt that muſt eſtabliſh your Dominion.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> I muſt ſay the People of that Nation
deſerve much to be cheriſhed; and I believe your late Declaration will much
glad their ſpirits; for nothing was more dreadfull to them, than a fear to be
over-run with Phanatick Notions.</p>
            <p>I humbly recommend them to your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Eſteem, and
deſire the intended Act of Union may be proſecuted, and their Taxes made
proportionable to thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> for which I am engaged by
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be an humble Suitor to you. And truly, Sir, I muſt ask leave to
entreat you to make a ſpeedy Proviſion for their Civil Government, of which
they have been <pb n="8" facs="tcp:174778:6"/>deſtitute near a year, to the ruine of many
Families; and except Commiſſioners for Management of the Government, and
Judges to ſit in Courts of Judicature, be ſpeedily appointed,

Names, both of Commiſſioners and Judges: But by reaſon of your great
Affairs, he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to deliver them in writing to you; but I now
